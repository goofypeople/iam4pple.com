    <p>Hello, my name's 4pple (or Apple)! I don't really have much of a reputation in anything but I've got 180 subscribers on YouTube. (that's cool, i guess)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm not good with html but I made this so that's something, right?</p>
    <p>Here's a cool text box to try!</p>
    <input type="text" name="textbox" placeholder="Type somthing..." />
